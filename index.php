            <p>A restaurant is an establishment that provides paid lodging on a short-term basis. Facilities provided may range from a modest-quality mattress in a small room to large suites with bigger, higher-quality beds, a dresser, a refrigerator and other kitchen facilities, upholstered chairs, a flat screen television, and en-suite bathrooms. Small, lower-priced restaurants may offer only the most basic guest services and facilities. Larger, higher-priced restaurants may provide additional guest facilities such as a swimming pool, business centre (with computers, printers, and other office equipment), childcare, conference and event facilities, tennis or basketball courts, gymnasium, restaurants, day spa, and social function services. Restaurant rooms are usually numbered (or named in some smaller restaurants and B&Bs) to allow guests to identify their room. Some boutique, high-end restaurants have custom decorated rooms. Some restaurants offer meals as part of a room and board arrangement. In the United Kingdom, a restaurant is required by law to serve food and drinks to all guests within certain stated hours.[citation needed] In Japan, capsule restaurants provide a tiny room suitable only for sleeping and shared bathroom facilities.</p>
            <p>Restaurant operations vary in size, function, complexity, and cost. Most restaurants and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify restaurant types. An upscale full-service restaurant facility offers luxury amenities, full service accommodations, an on-site restaurant, and the highest level of personalized service, such as a concierge, room service, and clothes pressing staff. Full service restaurants often contain upscale full-service facilities with a large number of full service accommodations, an on-site full service restaurant, and a variety of on-site amenities. Boutique restaurants are smaller independent, non-branded restaurants that often contain upscale facilities. Small to medium-sized restaurant establishments offer a limited amount of on-site amenities. Economy restaurants are small to medium-sized restaurant establishments that offer basic accommodations with little to no services. Extended stay restaurants are small to medium-sized restaurants that offer longer-term full service accommodations compared to a traditional restaurant.</p>
			<p>Most restaurant establishments are run by a General Manager who serves as the head executive (often referred to as the "Restaurant Manager"), department heads who oversee various departments within a restaurant (e.g., food service), middle managers, administrative staff, and line-level supervisors. The organizational chart and volume of job positions and hierarchy varies by restaurant size, function and class, and is often determined by restaurant ownership and managing companies.</p>
