# Restaurant_Information_System
The Restaurant Information System is a website which has been created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL and jQuery.
HTML is used for rendering the text on the website, i.e., HTML is responsible for the basic structure of the website.
We have used CSS for styling the website, which includes adding colors to various headings, text boxes as well as to div and span elements.
JavaScript is a language used for Client-side scripting. We have perfomed form validation with the help of JavaScript.
PHP is used for backend of the website. MySQL is also a key part of the backend, where databases can be created for storing values such as in this case, Restaurant inforamtion including the Restaurant_type, restaurant_faciltiy, restaurant_name, restaurant_address among many more details!
The most important part of the website is the Admin access page, where authorized personnel can exercise "control" over the webpage. The admins can add, edit or delete any restaurants as and when needed, along with fetching the restaurants report, and as an additional feature, they can change their admin access password as well to make sure its safe. This is possible because of the use of PHP and MySQL which is part of the backend of the website.
There is an option to search for your restaurant name as well, thats when jQuery comes in handy, which makes it easier and faster to fetch the search results you desire!
